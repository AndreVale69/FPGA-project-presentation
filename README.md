# Presentation and documentation FPGA Cloud

This project was created for a Computer Science course.

The aim is to create a documentation in English and in Italian to help teachers to choose which technology to use to program FPGA for their students.

At the moment, I've explored Amazon AWS EC2 F1 ([official webpage][1]). The next steps are to explore Microsoft Azure and Vivado.

The main language of the guide is English and you can download it [here][2]. The Italian version is not finished yet, but it will be written as soon as finished the English version is finished.
