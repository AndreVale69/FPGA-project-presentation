# Presentation and documentation FPGA Cloud

This project was created for a Computer Science course.

The aim is to create documentation in English and Italian to help teachers choose which technology to use to program FPGA for their students.

At the moment, I've explored Amazon AWS EC2 F1 ([official webpage][1]). The next steps are to explore Microsoft Azure and Vivado.

The guide is mainly in English, and you can download it [here][2]. The Italian version still needs to be finished, but it will be written as soon as the English version is finished.
