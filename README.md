# Presentation and documentation FPGA Cloud

This project was created for a Computer Science course.

The aim is to create documentation in English and Italian to help teachers choose which technology to use to program FPGA for their students.

The resources explored:
 - [Amazon AWS EC2 F1][1]
 - [Microsof Azure][2]
 - [Intel FPGA Academic Program][3]

The guide is mainly in English, and you can download it [here][4]. The Italian version still needs to be finished, but it will be written as soon as the English version is finished.
