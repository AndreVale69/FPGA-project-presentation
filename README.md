# Presentation and documentation FPGA Cloud

This project was created for a Computer Science course.

The goal is create a documentation in English and in Italian to help teachers choose which technology to use to program FPGA for students.

At the moment, I explored Amazon AWS EC2 F1 ([official webpage][1]). The next steps are explore Microsoft Azure and Vivado.
